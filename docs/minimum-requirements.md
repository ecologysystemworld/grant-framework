# Grant Project Minimum Requirements
- All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. 
  - We prefer MIT, but Apache 2.0, GPLv3, or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful token sale.
- Grant deliverables must contribute to the EOS network first and foremost.
- As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities.
- We require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works.
- At a minimum, written documentation is required for funding.
