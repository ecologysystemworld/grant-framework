#### EOS Network Foundation Grant Framework

# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What are the funding levels?

There are three levels of grants.  Please see [Grant Levels in our main README](../README.md/#grant-levels)

### What type of funding does the ENF grant?

The purpose of the grants is to enable developers, businesses and individuals to build on EOS. Grants vary in size based on the size and scope of the initiative. All forms of projects are open for submission, core chain modifications, tools, libraries, etc. However, strong technical projects that clearly add to the Public Good are preferred.

### Who can apply?

All projects except those that have conducted or will conduct a token sale.  The project must be open-source.

### Is there a way to get a partial payment up front?

No.

### How and when will I get paid?

The ENF makes payments after each milestone is approved.  The Grant Evaluators need to review the deliverables submitted in the milestones and approve them.  Then the invoice is filled out and the milestone amount will be paid in EOS to the account listed on the application.

### What if I want to leverage another open-source project.  Is that OK?

Yes.  As long as you abide by the licenses on that open-source project.

### What can I do if my application was rejected?

The Grant Committee strives to provide useful feedback. It is possible you can modify your application and re-apply.  Or try a different type project for funding.

### Why have other grants made it through the system faster than mine?

Each application is unique. They need to be approved by the Grant Committee first - which may result in a number of meetings to resolve a difference of opinion.  Secondly, the Grant Evaluators may request modifications to your application, which may also slow down the process.

## Application Process

### How long does it take from application to decision?

There are a number of factors that impact the timeline.  The requested amount, the number of changes requested by the evaluators, etc.  It usually takes a bit more than a week to go through the Grant Committee.  The Evaluation process dependes upon the changes they request.  You will be informed along the way.

### One of the Grant Evaluators approved my application - is it approved?

It depends on the grant size which will require between 2 and 4 approvals by the Grant Evaluators.  We will notify you by email when it is approved and merge your PR.

## After Approval

### When can I apply for a follow-up grant?

Once you have completed your current grant, you may apply for another one.

### What if I need to pause the project due to unforseen circmstances?

Please communicate with us at grants@eosn.foundation.  We will try to work with you on a plan.

### Can I list the EOS Network Foundation as a parner?

Only after you have completed your first milesone may you display the ENF grant badge in a context of the repository containing your work or an about page on your website.

### Will the ENF help promote my project?

While we do not provide PR servies, we will tweet about your project after you have delivered your first milestone and likely after each milestone has been completed.

### What if I realize it will be impossible to complete on of the milestones?

PLease contact us at grants@eosn.foundation and we will attempt to work out changes with you.  We will likely have you resubmit a moddified application which will be reviewed by the Committee.

## Milestone Delivery

### How do I submit a milestone?

For details, please refer to the [milestone delivery guidelines](./milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md) for the respective grants program.  Generally speaking, the most important part of a milestone delivery is a list of **the same deliverables listed in the application** with links to their specific commit or tag.  The list of deliverables for each of your milestones should be defined in your grant agreement.

### Can I submit two or more milestones at one?

No.  We need clear linkage to each milestone so we can separately assess, approve, and pay each.

### Can I add a badge to my repo once Iâ€™ve completed a milestone?

  Yes  - if your grant is [Level 2 or 3](../README.md#grant-levels) grant and your first milestone has been submitted **and accepted**. Please make sure that you follow the [badge guidelines](./grant-badge.md) when doing so.


### Why are other milestones being accepted or discussed faster than mine?

The Grant Evaluators may request information on your milestone, which may slow down the process.
