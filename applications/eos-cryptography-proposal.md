## Project Overview


### Overview
We are proposing to add different signature verification algorithms for EOS. There are different ways to achieve this, but back and forth with different core developers lands us on trying to implement them as SDK library for smart contracts, with probably OC compilation flag needed for more complex ECC math.


### Project Details

We implemented a [EOSIO Cryptography Kits](https://github.com/ZeroPass/eosio.ck) the fastest RSA implmenetation for EOSIO. It can ran RSA4096 verificaitons on the mainnet today. We also have a working [PoC Port smart contract](https://github.com/ZeroPass/eosio-port). The smart contract can already do passive and active passport attestation for passports based on RSA PKCS 1.5 PKI. 

The project itself is best described by deliverables, so to avoid repeating we will try to manage expectations by disclosing shortcomings of the presented use case of full-on Passport identity on EOS blockchain, that we come around to while deploying the server version. Some (rare) countries' old passports don’t have ANY passport cloning prevention mechanism (e.g.: older US passports before next geneartion passport - NGP). For those old passports we will have to use oracle, not full on-chain verification. That being said, this kind of verification can be flagged as lower-level confidence. All newer passports have some sort of protection against passport cloning, but some countries don't implement Active Authentication AA - they can’t sign and directly prove to the public that the passport isn’t cloned. This passports can only prove to an oracle (server) that the passport wasn't cloned using Diffie-Hellman based chip authentication protocol. In this case, the passport can be fully verified on-chain (trust chain), but passport genuineness has to be verified by the oracle. The verification can still be fully automated, but it does require some trust in the oracle's claims that it had verified the authenticity of the passport. The oracle passport verification will require some decent amount of crypto work. This proposal alone won’t be able to deliver everything to full completion, but it does solve 70% of the problems we have to make the Port solution come to life fully on blockchain.


### Ecosystem Fit

Port can be used as a better version of (anonymous) identity on the blockchain. It's open-source and open-access nature allows any dapp to plug into it, and profit from the infrastructure it provides. It fixes the issue with DIDs, where self-sovereign identity in the practice always gets implemented as one KYC provider signing the attestations. Here the passport proves authenticity itself, cutting the middle man and cutting friction associated with it. I.e.: removing the costs and needed trust (don't be evil, versus can't be evil). Adding different signature verification algorithms can serve as crypto primitive for EOSIO, and upon which our contract can be built on. To expand the use-cases we are mainly focusing on: making the Port a native way for EOS to solve Sybil protection, Identity, and multiple levels of verifications.

Right now, there are projects such as Pomelo and EOS Support integrating Port to help prevent Sybil attacks for their platforms (we would like to move it fully on-chain later). These signature verification algorithms will also benefit Randall Roland’s (CEO EOS Support) proposal that seeks to improve the user onboarding process of the EdenOS software. If successful, it might be the basis for the identity of the future Eden version. The development would allow users to skip video calls for Sybil check and switch to a more asynchronous election. Group calls could be postponed to a better time for everyone in the group, or could even become optional if the groups can achieve consensus on Telegram chats. Our team has also been contacted by different NFT projects looking to do wide NFT drops, without the claimed abuse they detect right now. There are nice humanitarian applications, for instance, somebody can start an easy project to provide UBI-style donations to people with Ukrainian passports.

## Development Status

**RSA PoC**
We painstakingly built, optimized, tested and deployed on the testnet to make it the fastest wasm RSA implementation in eosio. For example, it can verify RSA 4096 bit keys consistently under 10ms (3ms on average, much faster for the more standard  RSA 2048 bit).
- https://github.com/ZeroPass/eosio.ck


Our team built and deployed Port itself (server solution) that acts as our beta version for what we are trying to move on chain. In addition, we already experimented and built Port PoC smart contract for passport attestation on-chain (RSA PKCS 1.5 PKI only). 
- https://github.com/ZeroPass/eosio-port

We can also attach research from our documentation (which is not completly up to date). It is presented in the [In-depth section](https://github.com/ZeroPass/Port-documentation-and-tools#in-depth).

## Development Roadmap

We want to charge 30k$ to open source it (MIT license). That will also allow us to commit to work on the next items, even when delivery itself isn’t guaranteed because of unknown unknowns and EOSVM  limits that might turn multiple taken approaches into a no-go.  

### Milestone 2 - RSASSA-PSS

### Milestone 3 - EC math primitives

- **Estimated duration:** 4-6 month
- **FTE:** 9-12 FTE months
- **Costs:** 44,000 USD

| 3b. | Benchmark | Benchmarking 2b to determine its viability for running it on the public EOSIO networks (optional*)|
| 3c. | Benchmark | Benchmarking 2c to determine its viability for running it on the public EOSIO networks (optional*)|

This will allow defining higher-level cryptography EC algorithms (e.g. ECDSA verification algo) on custom elliptic curves in smart contract. **The primitives will be built on top of the existing secure and audited EC cryptography library.**    
  
**Important\*;** 
- If deliverable 1a will be preformant enough, we won't deliver deliver 1b and 1c, only deliverable 1a.
- If deliverable 1b will be preformant enough, we won't deliver deliver 1c, only deliverable 1a and 1b.
- If only deliverable 1c will be preformant enough, we well deliver all 3.  

Same logic applies to coresponding Example implementation for **Secp256r1** and their benchmarking


## Future Plans
**Expected Part 2 of the proposal**  
Based on reviewers feedback we split the proposal into two parts, the content might vary based on resoults achived in the Milestone 4. For now expect proposal for 5 additional EC curves + a possible "system contract" implementation. Most risks moved into the first part of the proposal, which is repriced to reflect that. The target price is the same, with addition of two more eliptic curves ending up costing $10k more ($5k per eliptic curve).

**Pending additional research;**  
We might be able to also implement ECC curve alt_bn128 curve which is widely available on other major blockchain platforms like EVM and Polkadot. We will feel more comfortable promising delivery after at least ECC general implementation is done.

We are planning to rebuild [Port](https://port.link/) on-chain, and this proposal provides the crypto primitives needed to begin the process.
Our RSA PKCS 1.5 implementation is also already used in our another project: [ROW](https://row.link/), which hopefully will one day become a full-fledged webauthn signer.
In the more distant future we are also planning to build dapp on top these projects, using both on-chain Port and ROW projects as building blocks.
