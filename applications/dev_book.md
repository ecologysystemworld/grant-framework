## Project Overview

Our team has described many missing aspects in EOSIO infosphrere in
its Core+ Blue Paper which was sponsored by ENF back in autumn
2021. Recently our senior consultant, widely known under the "cc32d9"
pseudonym, has started writing a book for software EOSIO developers,
trying to cover the topics described in the paper.

Several chapters are already available for the public, and they met a
great interest among the developer community.

Some material for the book was previously published in the [cc32d9
blog](https://cc32d9.medium.com/).


### Overview

- **Name:** EOSIO Smart Contract Developer's Handbook.

- **Brief Description:** Writing a book for EOSIO contract developers.

- **Relationship to EOSIO:** The book will focus on EOSIO architecture.

- **Reason for Interest:** cc32d9 is a senior engineer working primarily in the EOSIO ecosystem in the past 4 years.


### Project Details

The book is targeting senior engineers and application architects, as
well as beginner developers who want to understand the inner workings
of an EOSIO blockchain.

Topics to be covered within this grant application:

- High-level view on blockchain and its components.

- `nodeos` daemon and its function and roles in the blockchain infrastructure.

- Life cycle of a transaction.

- How a smart contract works: in-depth description of the processes which are hidden from the developer and poorly documented.

- Smart contract security (based on a previously published blog article)

- Smart contract data design: planning and building smart contract tables, indexes, and queries.

- Performance and scaling: do's and dont's, and best practices in building a scalable application.


Additional topics for future grant applications:

- Design patterns: typical tasks and approaches.

- Practical examples and usage scenarions.

- Contract development kits (CDT, CLSDK, ...)

- Off-chain software development: data collectors, history, oracles, CPU sponsoring, RNG, etc.

- Feedback from the audience


### Ecosystem Fit

Knowledge sharing and best-practice guides is what has been lacking in
EOSIO ecosystem in the past 4 years. This book is aiming to change
that situation, so that new developers could start working with the
EOSIO software as efficiently as possible.
