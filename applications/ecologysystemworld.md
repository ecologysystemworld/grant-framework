## Project Overview


### Overview


- **Name:** Ecology System World
- **Brief Description:**  ESW is a project of a food supply chain. Its goal is to track and certify the provenance of the food and make sure that the food you put on your table wasn't adulterated. With ESW you'll scan the label and get the history of the product.

### Ecosystem Fit

> Help us locate your project in the EOSIO landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? The project will define a new protocol that could be use on the whole EOSIO ecosystem.
- Who is your target audience? Producers, manufacturers, retailers, transporters, Fairtrade organizations, consumers.
- What need(s) does your project meet? ESW takes care of eliminating counterfeiting from the world and therefore making people distinguish what is original from what is false even if the product or food is practically identical.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem?
  - Currently there are no other projects delivering similar products in the EOSIO ecosystem. Looking outside the EOSIO ecosystem there are projects working in this direction but struggling with the constrains imposed by the other low performance blockchain.

## Future Plans

- Our mission is to define a standard for tracking NFTs. 
- The team will deploy ESW smart contract into main EOSIO sidechain icluding WAX and TELOS eventually expanding also to TRUST EVM to allow IBC.
- We will start by tracking high quality european goods including Italian and French wines exported around the world and later on expand to commodities as the adoption raises.



## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** EOS Network Foundation Website and social media account.

- We are already in contact with some local Italian companies/producers interested into using our protocol to certify their goods.
